## Getting Started

### Installation
```bash
pip install langgraph openai
```

### Basic Usage
```python
import langgraph
import openai

# Define nodes
def get_user_input():
    return input("User: ")

def process_input(user_input):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]
    )
    return response['choices'][0]['message']['content']

def respond(response):
    print(f"Agent: {response}")

# Create graph
graph = langgraph.Graph()
graph.add_node("input", get_user_input)
graph.add_node("process", process_input)
graph.add_node("respond", respond)
graph.add_edge("input", "process")
graph.add_edge("process", "respond")
graph.add_edge("respond", "input")  # Loop back for continuous interaction

# Execute graph
graph.run("input")
```
