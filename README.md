# LangGraph-Agents

This repository contains advanced applications of LangGraph with agent-based architectures. These agents use memory, tools, and LLMs to interact intelligently with tasks and adapt their behavior dynamically.

## 🧠 Agent Projects Overview

### 1. `Agent_Bot.py`
A simple agent that takes inputs and routes them through basic graph structures. Ideal for understanding the core agent abstraction.

### 2. `Memory_Bot.py`
An agent that incorporates memory, allowing it to remember previous inputs and context over multiple turns.

### 3. `ReAct.py`
Implements the ReAct paradigm — combining reasoning and acting to solve tasks interactively with environment feedback.

### 4. `Drafter.py`
This agent acts as a content or email drafter. It constructs drafts based on user inputs and context.

### 5. `RAG_Agent.py`
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation agent that queries an external vector database (or document store) to augment its answers with relevant content.
